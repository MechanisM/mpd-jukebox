So... this is a steaming pile of feces at this point...

very basic operation at the moment, allows adding and removing of songs from
the playlist...

I have plans to bring a lot more to this project, but it's out there, in case
anyone else wants to take a crack at it.


add the following to mpd.conf to enable streaming:
audio_output {
    type        "shout"
    encoding    "ogg"           # optional
    name        "Jukebox"
    host        "localhost"
    port        "8000"
    mount       "/jukebox.ogg"
    password    "hackmelol"
    bitrate     "192"
    format      "44100:16:1"
}

install mpd, icecast2, and mysql-server, and ... yeah, i'll get more info
here... someday...

TODO (in rough order of likelihood i'll get around to them...)
-clean up the user interface
-multiple streaming stations
-bring in mpd-similar project to suggest songs
-display/fetch album artwork
-add voting
    -vote a song up songs to move it up the playlist
    -vote down to remove the song (with enough votes)
-karma system
    -encourage upvoting
    -discourage excessive downvoting
    -restrict number of songs able to add depending on karma
-vote for output to speakers, in addition to streaming
-ambient volume voting (for an office or communal jukebox)
