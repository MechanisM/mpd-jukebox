So... this is a steaming pile of feces at this point...

very basic operation at the moment, allows adding and removing of songs from
the playlist...

I have plans to bring a lot more to this project, but it's out there, in case
anyone else wants to take a crack at it.


add the following to mpd.conf to enable streaming:
audio_output {
    type        "shout"
    encoding    "ogg"           # optional
    name        "Jukebox"
    host        "localhost"
    port        "8000"
    mount       "/jukebox.ogg"
    password    "hackmelol"
    bitrate     "192"
    format      "44100:16:1"
}

install mpd, icecast2, and mysql-server, and ... yeah, i'll get more info
here... someday...

TODO
clean up the user interface, make it look nice
add voting, vote up songs to move up the playlist, vote down to remove them
karma system, encouraging up-votes
vote for output to speakers, instead of just streaming
ambient volume voting (for an office or communal jukebox)
... more
